If you need this, well then I would highly recommend this book to you.<br/><br/>Also, and this is a gripe of mine throughout the book, the author finds it pertinent to add some particularly dispensable phrases that really make him come across as a pompous individual (e.f. “Facebook, at best, added one more (arguably quite mediocre) entertainment option to many that already existed” - I don’t even use Facebook, but why write ‘arguably mediocre’?

      "American Gods\n",
      "Goodness me… This book was truly remarkable. <br/>Perhaps it was the portions I listened to through an audiobook, or perhaps it was the portions I read in my physical copy of the book, but regardless of how it came to happen, this book truly touched me. <br/>As someone who grew up in America, the philosophy of Neil Gaiman that he weaves into the story of this book truly hits home. It’s not about new gods, it’s not about old gods, and it surely isn’t about liking or not liking the main character, Shadow (not that I didn’t like him, because I thought he was extremely interesting); it’s about the message. I feel like in most books, particularly classical literature, you receive a final message after completing the book, a message that can help you in shaping your ideals, whether you agreed with the author’s ideas or not. <br/>In this case I agreed, and I loved how the story unfolded. I wanted to know what would happen next. In fact, after completing the book, I have questions; perhaps they can be answered and perhaps they can’t, but I truly love it when books linger in my memory, when they have a lasting impact. In all honesty, I finished this book a few days ago, but I wanted to wait and gather my thoughts before officially giving a quick review/synopsis of my thoughts on the book. <br/>Despite all of my praise though, this book isn’t for everyone; what took me so long to get through it was the beginning. I found it to be confusing, very confusing in fact, and it wasn’t until the end of the book that I finally understood the significance of the beginning. However, I find this to be the case with a lot of Neil Gaiman’s literary works so I continued onward. Although knowing that Neil Gaiman tends to unveil new secrets as the story progresses got me through the first 200 pages or so, it could be quite bothersome for people who do not have the patience or wish to commit so much time to understanding the book’s contents. <br/><br/>Regardless, I wholly enjoyed this book, and I would highly recommend it to those who are looking for an eye-opening read, are familiar with Neil Gaiman’s work, and aren’t in a time crunch. <br/>\n",

It was enjoyable and I particularly liked its liberal use of metaphors as a way to explore relationship dynamics. <br/><br/>However the constant use of \"he said\" and \"she said\" in every single poem, was very monotonous, and I wish other methods of incorporating those phrases were used instead of just attaching those phrases at the end of every other line. In my opinion, that would have really strengthened the collection as a whole. <br/><br/>Also, slightly off-topic, I found that the last poem \"Tone or Mood\" was very heavy-handed in its way it tried to tie all of the poems together and explicitly say 'it's all a metaphor,' just in case someone was confused. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't want to be told things with poetry, so I wish this poem didn't explicitly say that and employed different methods of ending the collection.<br/><br/>Notable Poems: \"More or Less\" & \"That Particular Disease\"\n",

Instead this novel focuses mainly, in my pov, on mother/daughter relationships, and what they entail; what constitutes as a good mother, and how far 'should' a mother go to protect her daughter before sacrificing her own wants/needs, etc.? <br/><br/>Honestly, this is the part of the novel that truly stood out to me, and felt the most fleshed out, while the dystopian setting felt like more of a surrounding thought experiment - one I am still thinking about mind you, because I found it so interesting. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is an interesting novel that is worth the read - it's not perfect by any means, but it is definitely interesting, in a positive way, and I can't wait to read future work by Diane Cook!\n",

      "Queenie\n",
      "I ended up picking this book up when I saw it was part of the 2020 Women's Prize Longlist, and I am glad I did as it was quite interesting. <br/><br/>Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams challenges the stereotypes of being a black women by following the life of Queenie, a black woman with Jamaican heritage living in London and working in the Journalism industry, who struggles greatly in her everyday life. She has an unhealthy relationship with men, intense anxiety, and more issues that she works through or accepts throughout the course of her journey in the novel. This journey in becoming someone who can accept herself is a slow but powerful journey that will leave an impact on readers willing to overlook some of the books flaws. <br/><br/>While the book's latter half is incredibly impactful, a reader's journey to get there is difficult. The first 50-60% of the book solely discusses Queenie's relationship with men, and her tendency to make what many would consider \"wrong\" choices time and time again. I believe this focus took up too much of the book, and cutting certain scenes would have helped the pacing of the book overall. Along with that, Queenie suffers a miscarriage at the beginning of the book, and how she feels about that experience isn't really explored until when she seeks therapy (70% of the book), in which it's only mentioned in passing. Another aspect of the book that felt added on as an embellishment was the Black Lives Matter Movement, which is truly a shame because I would have loved to see this aspect more integrated in Queenie's character as it would have really solidified her motives for wanting to enter the journalism industry, and would have just given her character a lot more substance and body; at times she felt a bit flat, as she didn't seem to have any interests, and even the ones she had weren't really explored in the book unfortunately. Also, and more obviously, adding more substance and importance on the Black Lives Matter Movement would have been incredible in shedding more light on the systemic inequality black people face in the UK and US - this novel could have made a larger statement without deviating too much from the main plot I believe.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized how Queenie didn't want to date black men, and I want to explore that a bit more here. In the book, readers are explicitly told that Queenie doesn't date black men because of an experience as a child she had that made her anxious in the company of a black men, and it isn't ever explicitly addressed for the rest of the novel. However, when Queenie described her relationship with Roy, her mother's boyfriend, when she was younger, and how he mentally abused her that clicked with me as to why she would be hesitant to date black men. I truly wonder if this subtext was the author's intent, but I am sticking by it all the same until a better explanation is stated. <br/><br/>On to the explicitly positive things I enjoyed in this novel. I found that the Jamaican elements and slang (KMT) as they added a ton to the narrative, and I felt incredibly invested in Queenie's well-being and the overall plot. Also, this is a very impactful novel that has remained in my thoughts for the past couple months; it is incredibly memorable and thought-provoking. <br/><br/>Overall, although I believe this book tried to achieve too much, I would still recommend it though to people looking for an impactful novel.\n",

If anything this novel is a wake up call for me, as it reaffirms that vignette-styled novels simply cannot hold my attention. <br/><br/>I just honestly don't think it is worth the read, as more digestible literature exists in the market that discuss similar topics.\n",

      "Ella Minnow Pea: A Novel in Letters\n",
      "What an incredibly clever book! Overall I learned a multitude of words from it and enjoyed it, despite a few glaring faults: <br/><br/><spoiler><br/><br/>- The Romance element in the book was unnecessary in my opinion and really didn't add much other than providing an outsider element as the catalyst for the \"game\" in the book. <br/><br/>- The \"game\" in book is cute, but doesn't add a sense of urgency (at least for me). For me that was sensation was given by everyone leaving; that provided a greater sense of urgency than the actual plot. So overall, I don't think the game was a good plot device to drive the story, and could have been excluded in my opinion.<br/><br/>- The characters seemed to blend into one another; they weren't very fleshed out, and didn't have distinctive writing styles to individualize each person from one another. Only Amos was a bit fleshed out, and I enjoyed his character for the three/four letters he wrote. <br/><br/>- The ending was tied up in a clean bow, and I believe if the author left it very open ended and still in a totalitarian state, it would have provided a greater impact to the message of the book against totalitarianism and censorship. Perhaps a final act against the people in power... Or if they had her put in jail for the pangram written at the end instead of honoring their part of the bargain. I just don't think the book should have ended happily given the message. <br/><br/></spoiler><br/><br/>Can you believe despite all my gripes I still enjoyed this book? Haha - I had fun but I think it's only fair that I should acknowledge that certain aspects needed a bit more development in my eyes to make this novel a favorite of mine. \n",

As always, I love Patrick Rothfuss's writing, but I truly believe that was the sole reason I was able to get through this book, because the plot is very messy, trailing the reader from one tangent to another tangent to another tangent to another tangent to another tangent - and so on.

      "I really liked this book; it was relatable in a way that slightly stung (but in a good way because I am no longer that person) and really embodied the experience of college and discovering yourself and what you want to do in life. The subplots were engaging as well and even though I figured out who February Friday was before it was revealed I was still invested in the story.<br/><br/>The only portion of the book that I had major gripes with was the way it ended and resolved the main conflicts in the novel. These resolutions were almost cartoonish in the way they were addressed which was disappointing and I think a lot of that portion and my feelings toward it had to do with the writing. Issues like the ones discussed in the book aren’t as easily resolved as they made it out to be and I really wish a bit more focus and time was dedicated to the resolution to make it more believable. Not everyone has to have a happy ending if it doesn't make sense in the plot.  <br/><br/>Overall though, this is an enjoyable book for those born in the early 200s and late 90s (given the references made) who just want a happy ending.\n",

      "If I Had Your Face\n",
      "A very depressing novel focusing on the stories of 5 women living in South Korea. It shows in a slightly exaggerated manner the problematic beauty standards and prevalent sexism in South Korean culture. Also it sheds a light on the preferential treatment and social customs of the wealthy in comparison to those living day by day. <br/><br/>I feel conflicted about this novel; on one hand it emotionally affected me and shed light on issues I didn’t know existed, but on the other hand I didn’t feel invested in the story as it progressed. <br/><br/>I will say that some people might be aggravated because this novel lacks a clear goal in regards to plot, but I believe that is intentional. By taking it day-by-day the novel upholds the belief the women in the novel have; that they cannot look to the future when every day they face such challenges and they question whether or not to live or die.<br/><br/>A well crafted book, but perhaps not for everyone. I appreciated it though, and I think people should read it did they are interested.\n",

Despite this, I encourage others to read this book and come to their own conclusion. <br/><br/>Overall, an inspiring read that raises the question of what constitutes as a poem, but needed a bit more editing. <br/><br/>Standout Poems: \"The Old Man Who Knew Me 10 Years Ago\" & \"The Boy Drags His Doll\"\n",

My favorite story was \"A Most Blessed\" but everything went downhill from there. The other stories drawled onwards for what seemed like forever or I blinked and they were over just like that and I just felt... apathetic. I felt like the author intended to evoke a particular emotion but all the context clues to that emotion were fleeting or hidden under tons of innuendo. <br/><br/>Sometimes too much is too much.\n",

At the same time, I feel like someone could look at this book as a literal bridge among cultures; that love transcends war. <br/><br/>Overall this book was a poet's dream; a book riddled with inspiring and beautiful language that tells an interpretable story for whomever reads it. <br/><br/>This book is not perfect; I think it suffered a bit from pacing issues and the like in the middle or so, when things started moving towards love. Also, I believe that the novel would have been more impactful if the relationship between Red and Blue wasn't framed as a love story. Nonetheless, I am incredibly impressed with what this novel has achieved.\n",

I grew up in Florida and was intrigued by the premise of this novel, but I didn’t realize what an impact it would have on me. <br/><br/>Although the prose is not my preferred style, I just have to say this is an incredible novel shedding light on a place not known to many to have existed. Also I enjoyed that the emotional impact occurred as a slow burn due to the non-gratuitous depictions of violence; it is truly refreshing to see in a premise that could have easily added such embellishments.<br/><br/>The ending broke me down and I wept silently under the weight of this novel’s words; the epilogue increased the speed of those tears. <br/><br/>Truly a novel deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.\n",

It is raw and heartfelt, and although the character is unlikeable at times, as the reader continues he/she/they learn what experiences/events might have contributed to the main character's attitude. <br/><br/>Some people might complain about the length, but I think it was justifiable as it really ensured that the reader understood the feelings that the main character was going through throughout the course of her abuse; I think it was necessary to convey what was needed in the book. <br/><br/>Honestly... This book is nearly perfect in my eyes. Well researched, emotionally charged, well-written in a way that made sense given the story. <br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who would not be triggered by it. \n",

Perhaps it's the fact that I greatly enjoy classical literature and my partner enjoys philosophy that really allowed this book to speak to me, or perhaps it was the honest portrayal that the author provides, as James Joyce did in Ulysses. I can't say for sure. <br/><br/>What I can say is that I would recommend this book, even though it has a particularly interesting perspective on Mr. Antolini's & Holden's relationship in Catcher in the Rye that I respectfully disagree with. <br/>\n",

But not even that was truly explored in a satisfying way... and yet I still enjoyed this tremendously; it’s honestly so confusing for me. I think the build up was just so thrilling that I’m still in a a bit of a cloud nine situation because of it but objectively, I don’t know if this book is worth the read. Weird indeed.\n",
