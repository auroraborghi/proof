Although I didn’t hate this (in fact I got some knowledge nuggets out of it that I think will really help my day to day life happenings), I truly think this book should have been a set of blog posts or a short novella. So many of the latter Rule Chapters are bloated, Part 1 seemed unnecessary, and the book as a whole would have benefited from some more editing. <br/><br/>Then again, keep in mind that I am someone that values the economy of language and doesn’t need to be convinced four times or more in a single chapter that working until 5:30 and no later is a good habit to have, if applicable to your life for example. If you need this, well then I would highly recommend this book to you.<br/><br/>Also, and this is a gripe of mine throughout the book, the author finds it pertinent to add some particularly dispensable phrases that really make him come across as a pompous individual (e.f. “Facebook, at best, added one more (arguably quite mediocre) entertainment option to many that already existed” - I don’t even use Facebook, but why write ‘arguably mediocre’? What purpose does this parenthetical statement have?), which is unfortunate given that this book preaches his mantra.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It’s not about new gods, it’s not about old gods, and it surely isn’t about liking or not liking the main character, Shadow (not that I didn’t like him, because I thought he was extremely interesting); it’s about the message. I feel like in most books, particularly classical literature, you receive a final message after completing the book, a message that can help you in shaping your ideals, whether you agreed with the author’s ideas or not. <br/>In this case I agreed, and I loved how the story unfolded. I wanted to know what would happen next. In fact, after completing the book, I have questions; perhaps they can be answered and perhaps they can’t, but I truly love it when books linger in my memory, when they have a lasting impact. In all honesty, I finished this book a few days ago, but I wanted to wait and gather my thoughts before officially giving a quick review/synopsis of my thoughts on the book. <br/>Despite all of my praise though, this book isn’t for everyone; what took me so long to get through it was the beginning. I found it to be confusing, very confusing in fact, and it wasn’t until the end of the book that I finally understood the significance of the beginning. However, I find this to be the case with a lot of Neil Gaiman’s literary works so I continued onward. Although knowing that Neil Gaiman tends to unveil new secrets as the story progresses got me through the first 200 pages or so, it could be quite bothersome for people who do not have the patience or wish to commit so much time to understanding the book’s contents. <br/><br/>Regardless, I wholly enjoyed this book, and I would highly recommend it to those who are looking for an eye-opening read, are familiar with Neil Gaiman’s work, and aren’t in a time crunch. <br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It was enjoyable and I particularly liked its liberal use of metaphors as a way to explore relationship dynamics. <br/><br/>However the constant use of ""he said"" and ""she said"" in every single poem, was very monotonous, and I wish other methods of incorporating those phrases were used instead of just attaching those phrases at the end of every other line. In my opinion, that would have really strengthened the collection as a whole. <br/><br/>Also, slightly off-topic, I found that the last poem ""Tone or Mood"" was very heavy-handed in its way it tried to tie all of the poems together and explicitly say 'it's all a metaphor,' just in case someone was confused. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't want to be told things with poetry, so I wish this poem didn't explicitly say that and employed different methods of ending the collection.<br/><br/>Notable Poems: ""More or Less"" & ""That Particular Disease""",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Instead this novel focuses mainly, in my pov, on mother/daughter relationships, and what they entail; what constitutes as a good mother, and how far 'should' a mother go to protect her daughter before sacrificing her own wants/needs, etc.? <br/><br/>Honestly, this is the part of the novel that truly stood out to me, and felt the most fleshed out, while the dystopian setting felt like more of a surrounding thought experiment - one I am still thinking about mind you, because I found it so interesting. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is an interesting novel that is worth the read - it's not perfect by any means, but it is definitely interesting, in a positive way, and I can't wait to read future work by Diane Cook!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Perhaps it is because I just read a poetry collection about grief and loss (<i>Tenacity of Lace</i>) that really emotionally touched me, but this book just didn't evoke many of the ground-breaking feelings that I expected it to. I suspect it might be because of the more simplistic writing style bordering on telling the reader too explicitly at times.

She has an unhealthy relationship with men, intense anxiety, and more issues that she works through or accepts throughout the course of her journey in the novel. This journey in becoming someone who can accept herself is a slow but powerful journey that will leave an impact on readers willing to overlook some of the books flaws. <br/><br/>While the book's latter half is incredibly impactful, a reader's journey to get there is difficult. The first 50-60% of the book solely discusses Queenie's relationship with men, and her tendency to make what many would consider ""wrong"" choices time and time again. I believe this focus took up too much of the book, and cutting certain scenes would have helped the pacing of the book overall. Along with that, Queenie suffers a miscarriage at the beginning of the book, and how she feels about that experience isn't really explored until when she seeks therapy (70% of the book), in which it's only mentioned in passing. Another aspect of the book that felt added on as an embellishment was the Black Lives Matter Movement, which is truly a shame because I would have loved to see this aspect more integrated in Queenie's character as it would have really solidified her motives for wanting to enter the journalism industry, and would have just given her character a lot more substance and body; at times she felt a bit flat, as she didn't seem to have any interests, and even the ones she had weren't really explored in the book unfortunately. Also, and more obviously, adding more substance and importance on the Black Lives Matter Movement would have been incredible in shedding more light on the systemic inequality black people face in the UK and US - this novel could have made a larger statement without deviating too much from the main plot I believe.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized how Queenie didn't want to date black men, and I want to explore that a bit more here. In the book, readers are explicitly told that Queenie doesn't date black men because of an experience as a child she had that made her anxious in the company of a black men, and it isn't ever explicitly addressed for the rest of the novel. However, when Queenie described her relationship with Roy, her mother's boyfriend, when she was younger, and how he mentally abused her that clicked with me as to why she would be hesitant to date black men. I truly wonder if this subtext was the author's intent, but I am sticking by it all the same until a better explanation is stated. <br/><br/>On to the explicitly positive things I enjoyed in this novel. I found that the Jamaican elements and slang (KMT) as they added a ton to the narrative, and I felt incredibly invested in Queenie's well-being and the overall plot. Also, this is a very impactful novel that has remained in my thoughts for the past couple months; it is incredibly memorable and thought-provoking. <br/><br/>Overall, although I believe this book tried to achieve too much, I would still recommend it though to people looking for an impactful novel.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,

Overall I learned a multitude of words from it and enjoyed it, despite a few glaring faults: <br/><br/><spoiler><br/><br/>- The Romance element in the book was unnecessary in my opinion and really didn't add much other than providing an outsider element as the catalyst for the ""game"" in the book. <br/><br/>- The ""game"" in book is cute, but doesn't add a sense of urgency (at least for me). For me that was sensation was given by everyone leaving; that provided a greater sense of urgency than the actual plot. So overall, I don't think the game was a good plot device to drive the story, and could have been excluded in my opinion.<br/><br/>- The characters seemed to blend into one another; they weren't very fleshed out, and didn't have distinctive writing styles to individualize each person from one another. Only Amos was a bit fleshed out, and I enjoyed his character for the three/four letters he wrote. <br/><br/>- The ending was tied up in a clean bow, and I believe if the author left it very open ended and still in a totalitarian state, it would have provided a greater impact to the message of the book against totalitarianism and censorship. Perhaps a final act against the people in power... Or if they had her put in jail for the pangram written at the end instead of honoring their part of the bargain. I just don't think the book should have ended happily given the message. <br/><br/></spoiler><br/><br/>Can you believe despite all my gripes I still enjoyed this book? Haha - I had fun but I think it's only fair that I should acknowledge that certain aspects needed a bit more development in my eyes to make this novel a favorite of mine. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Issues like the ones discussed in the book aren’t as easily resolved as they made it out to be and I really wish a bit more focus and time was dedicated to the resolution to make it more believable.

Why read the prose when I can just jot down new book to read and read that book instead? I wish the authors chose to have the <i>Notes</i> after every chapter and the recommendations at the end.<br/><br/>Nonfiction does this to me, and sadly the biographies for each author were too long for me to keep interest and the prose wasn't exactly my style either. <br/><br/>Overall though, I would still recommend this book for anyone who champions horror, and I may revisit it in the future.
